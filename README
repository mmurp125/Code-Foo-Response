Code-Foo Challenge

1) How many pennies could you put on the Golden Gate Bridge without any of them overlapping?
For this question, please write out each step in your thought process.
	a)	The length of the Golden Gate Bridge is 2 737.4 meters.
	b)	The width of the bridge is 27.4 meters.
	c)	I am assuming that I can only put pennies on the deck, and that the deck has the dimensions 2737.4m by 27.4m
	d)	If I place pennies on the bridge vertically, than each pennie will have a rectangular area of 1.55mm by 19.05 mm
	e)	1.55 mm * 19.05 = 29.5275 mm^2	//area of a vertical pennie in mm
	f)	29.5275mm^2 * ( (1m)^2 / (1000mm)^2 ) = 0.0000295275m^2 //area of a vertical pennie in meters
	g)	The total area of the Golden Gate Bridge is 2737.4m * 27.4 = 75004.76m^2
	h)	total number of pennies =  75004.76m^2 / 0.0000295275m^2 = 2 540 166 285.6
	i)	I only have 3 significant figures
FINAL ANSWER:
	2.54e9	or two billion five hundred forty million

2) Our images have a ratio of 16:9, and our design layouts have 12 pixel wide increments (there are no limits on height).
Give examples of three image sizes that would have the correct ratio and would fit the design layout.
	192 x 108	//(16*12 x 9*12)
	384 x 216	//(16*12 x 9*12)*2
	576 x 324	//(16*12 x 9*12)*3

3) What is the minimum number of moves required for a knight to cover the entire chess board? Write a program to prove it.
Provide a graph with the move number on the x axis and the number of squares covered on the y axis.
	64 moves
	I didn't finish my program but I found the answer while designing it. My program was going to keep track of every
	space the knight had been and always pick a space that it had not visited yet. if the the program reached a dead end
	before filling every square, than it would back up until it was no longer trapped and move to a different possible space.
	this would continue until completion.

4) Creatively prove to us that you meet our value - Fire - that this would be more than just a job to you, and that you
are passionate about us.
	I aspire to be a software engineer, who makes games. I'm a college student but I've been gaming since I was 4 years
	old when my dad brought home a computer. He paid $1800 for a computer that had 32 megs of ram. The mechine ran
	windows 3.1 and had a dial up connection. With it, I played early PC games like doom. Games are awesome and I will
	one day be a contributer to the best games.

	In college I met some friends who are just as passionate about games as I am, and we started developing a game on the side.
	we meet at least once a week (usually more often) and collaborate. Our current project is well underway. The software
	architecture is complete, and we have prototyped almost every class. Since summer started I've started working on this
	project full time, and our code is getting ever more complete. From this project I've learned alot. I hope to make a
	release before summer ends.

	IGN has always been my go to source for reviews and news. I trust IGN reviews because there right. I've never played a game
	that I thought deserved a score much different from the one it got by IGN. I rely on IGN for game purchasing decisions, because
	games are expensive. I want a career in the gaming industry because I love games; A coding job with IGN would be a step into the
	gaming industry. Hell, I would do the job for free.

	I program in MATLAB (for school), and JAVA (for game making), but I'm excited to learn any language.
